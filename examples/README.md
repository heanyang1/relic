# Examples

Here are some Lisp programs that can be interpreted/compiled by Relic. Programs whose name matches regex `\d\.\d+` are exercise code from SICP and their name is the exercise number.

You can get more examples from [compile_test](../tests/compile_test.rs) and [eval_test](../tests/eval_test.rs).
