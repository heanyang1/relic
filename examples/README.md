# Examples

Here are some Lisp programs that can be compiled by Relic. Programs whose name matches regex `\d\.\d+` are answers to exercises from SICP and their name is the exercise number.

You can get more examples from [compile_test](../tests/compile_test.rs) and [eval_test](../tests/eval_test.rs).

## SDL2 Demo Package

[sdl2](sdl2/) folder contains a package that creates C bindings for several functions in SDL2. There is also a small demo that demonstrates the usage of these bindings.

Run `make` to compile the package. It assumes that you have installed SDL2 system-wide.
